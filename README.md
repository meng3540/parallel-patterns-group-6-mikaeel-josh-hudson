Welcome to The group 6 repository

here are some FAQs

1) What are parallel patterns in computing?
  
Parallel patterns are common methods or techniques used to solve problems regarding processing speed and efficiency, by performing multiple calculations or processes simultaneously. Parallel patterns help effectivley and efficiently utilize multicore processors (like the GPU) when executing algorithims. 
  
2) What is their significance?- Explain in the context of typical applications they are used in.



3) How is heterogeneous GPU-CPU computing useful in solving a parallel pattern?

Hetrogenouse GPU-CPU computing is useful because it uses the strengths of the CPU and GPU. GPU are great at data operations because of parallel process cabability and a high throughput where as CPU are great at task operations and scheduleing, combining these two result in more efficient processing of a wider range of tasks within a parallel pattern.
