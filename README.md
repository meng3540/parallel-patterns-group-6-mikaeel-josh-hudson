Welcome to The group 6 repository

here are some FAQs

1) What are parallel patterns in computing?
  
Parallel patterns are common methods or techniques used to solve problems regarding processing speed and efficiency, by performing multiple calculations or processes simultaneously. Parallel patterns help effectivley and efficiently utilize multicore processors (like the GPU) when executing algorithims. 
  
2) What is their significance?- Explain in the context of typical applications they are used in.



3) How is heterogeneous GPU-CPU computing useful in solving a parallel pattern?
