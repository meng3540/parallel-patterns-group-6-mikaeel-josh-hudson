The optimzations for Reduction parallel pattern includes:
- Reduction trees
- A simple reduction kernel
- Minimizing control divergence
- Minimizing memory divergence
- Minimizing global memory accesses
- Hierarchical reduction for arbitrary input length
- Thread coarsening for reduced overhead


Reduction trees:
This is an optimization technique where the reduction is performed in the sense that it forms a tree like structure. In this structure,instead of reducing
sequentially, the threads work in parallel on pairs of elements which in turn would reduce the amount of operations. The parallel reduction would progress
downwards  and the tasks are done in each step horizontally with less operations being done each time. In turn, this would allow for faster execution due 
to better parallelization and fewer points of synchronization with is step it takes in the tree structure.

A simple reduction kernel:
This is an optimization technique where each thread would be responsible for processesing a a different portion of the dataset and reduces it using basic 
operations.This makes it possible for all threads to collaborate across the entire grid unlike other optimizations. Hence, it provides a baseline parallel 
reduction method that can later be enhanced with other optimizations. In turn, it allows for simplicity and ease of implementation that compliments other
optimization techniques.

Minimizing control divergence:
This is an optimization technique that ensures that all threads in a warp or GPU would follow the same execution path which would not waste inactive 
threads. When threads take different execution paths, there is a possibility some threads become idle or inactive  while other threads are active in the 
warp which is reducing efficiency since it is wasting threads that are inactive. Hence, this technique would improve resource utilization where it would
not waste the inactive threads hence not wasting executing resources. This in turn will increases throughput by keeping all threads active for proper 
resource utilization.

Minimizing memory divergence:
This is an optimization technique that ensures that threads access memory in a coalesced or aligned manner within each warp to improve efficiency.
If threads access scattered memory locations that are adjacent to each other, memory access becomes inefficient since adjacent threads do not access
adjacent locations which in turn increases latency.However, this optimization allows for the threads are coalesced for efficient memory access. This 
in turn would reduces memory access time and as such improve overall performance.

Minimizing global memory accesses:
In this optimization technique, shared memory would be used or registers instead of repeatedly accessing global memory which is much slower. Global memory 
accesses are slow, while shared memory and registers are much faster which can also be used to compliment other optimizations which in turn would 
reduce latency and has a higher bandwidth than with global memory. Execution speed would be improved in the long run.

Hierarchical reduction for arbitrary input length:
This optimization technique is a flexible reduction approach that divides work across multiple levels of reduction. It Ensures that large input sizes do not 
cause load imbalance and are processed efficiently. Scales well for large datasets and prevents performance degradation.

Thread coarsening for reduced overhead:
Each thread processes multiple elements instead of just one, reducing the number of kernel launches and synchronization points.  Reduces thread scheduling 
overhead and improves computation-to-memory access ratio. Improves GPU utilization and reduces kernel launch overhead.
