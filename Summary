Reduction is a parallel computation pattern used to combine a collection of values into a single result using an associative operation such as summation, multiplication, or finding the maximum/minimum. The process involves partitioning the data across multiple processing units, computing partial results in parallel, and then aggregating those partial results to produce the final output. Common operations in reduction include summation, product calculation, and logical operations like AND/OR. For example, in OpenMP, reduction can be implemented using a reduction(+:sum) clause to sum an array efficiently. In CUDA, a tree-based approach is often used to minimize synchronization overhead. Optimizations such as tree-based reduction, hierarchical reduction, and atomic operations help improve performance by reducing computation time and avoiding race conditions. Reduction is widely used in parallel computing to accelerate data aggregation tasks, making it essential for applications like big data processing, machine learning, and scientific computing
